# Build progress (DEC 56)

One branch, `build/s17-onward`, a git tag per finished session (`sNN-done`).
Each session: sandbox gates pass (lint, tsc, Jest, pgTAP, rpc contract) before its tag.
Device checks (G8) are deferred to the testing phase at the end.

| Session | Status | Tag | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| S17 Sell 2 | done | s17-done | Mac verify PASS (2026-09-28); G8 deferred; fix e52dbba (stale reservation) |
